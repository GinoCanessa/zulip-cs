# Early Development Warning

Note that this package is in the EARLY development stages and should not be used in production.

# Zulip C# Library

`zulip-cs-lib` is a library to connect to [Zulip](http://zulip.com) services.

The project was started because the current community C# library ([Zulip-CSharp](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-csharp)) was built in earlier versions of .Net and takes a lot of dependencies I didn't want (e.g., RestSharp, Newtonsoft JS).

Code was developed using both [Zulip-CSharp](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-csharp) and [Zulip-JS](https://github.com/zulip/zulip-js) as inspiriation.
